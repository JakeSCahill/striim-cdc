Connection Control]
* `+localhost+` or `+IP address of oracledb container+` does not work
for `+Connection URL+` so you need to use your HOST IP address.
* As you can see above, service section of `+Connection URL+` is
configured as a `+/orclpdb1.localdomain+`, not as `+:ORCLCDB+`. If you
configure service as a `+:ORCLCDB+`, `+STRIIM+` application or
`+C##STRIIM+` common user can not reach/list `+PRODUCT_INV+` table which
is under `+STRIIM+` local user because of `+CDB specific+` bug at Striim
template itself. We will update these infos with the correct ones before
deploy the application. By the way, we have already contacted with them
and reported this issue. They will provide to fix at future releases. If
you use Oracle DB *without CDB*, you are not affect bt this issue.
